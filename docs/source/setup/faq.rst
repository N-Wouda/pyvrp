How do I...
-----------

.. glossary::

   ... install the latest PyVRP from ``main`` without having to compile things myself?

      The latest prebuilt binaries can be found `here <https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP/actions/workflows/CD.yml>`_.

   ... compile PyVRP from source on Windows machines?

      We do not know either.
      We use `CIBW <https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel>`_ via GitHub Actions to produce Windows binaries for us, because none of the PyVRP developers have a functioning Windows enviroment available either.
