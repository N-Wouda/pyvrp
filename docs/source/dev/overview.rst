Overview
========

This document provides an overview of the PyVRP project, and particularly of the PyVRP solver codebase.

Project
-------

The `PyVRP organisation <https://github.com/PyVRP>`_ on GitHub consists of several repositories.
The most important are the following:

* `PyVRP <https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP>`_, which contains the PyVRP solver.

* `VRPLIB <https://github.com/PyVRP/VRPLIB>`_, a utility package for reading and writing VRPLIB-formatted problem instances and their solutions.
  We use this package for benchmarking and testing.

* `Instances <https://github.com/PyVRP/Instances>`_, a collection of academic benchmark instances and their solutions.
  These instances and solutions can be read using the VRPLIB package.
