        This method uses the :meth:`~search` and :meth:`~intensify` methods to
        iteratively improve the given solution. First, :meth:`~search` is
        applied. Thereafter, :meth:`~intensify` is applied. This repeats until
        no further improvements are found. Finally, the improved solution is
        returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        solution
            The solution to improve through local search.
        cost_evaluator
            Cost evaluator to use.
        neighbours
            New granular neighbourhood if passed.

        Returns
        -------
        Solution
            The improved solution. This is not the same object as the
            solution that was passed in.
