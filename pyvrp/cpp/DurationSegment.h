 *     earliest_start: int,

 *
 * Creates a duration segment.
 *
 * Duration segments can be efficiently concatenated, and track statistics
 * about route duration and time warp resulting from visiting clients in the
 * concatenated order.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * idx_first
 *     Index of the first client in the route segment.
 * idx_last
 *     Index of the last client in the route segment.
 * duration
 *     Total duration, including waiting time.
 * earliest_start
 *     Earliest moment to start service at the first client in the segment that
 *     will result in minimal time warp, waiting time and route duration.
 * latest_finish
 *     Latest moment to finish service of the last client in the segment that
 *     will result in minimal time warp, waiting time and route duration.
 * release_time
 *     Earliest moment to start the route segment.
